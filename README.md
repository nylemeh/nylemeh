## 🌍 Social Impact Background

Before transitioning into QA, I worked in **social services**, supporting unaccompanied minors and coordinating across legal, educational, and healthcare systems. This experience taught me to navigate complexity with empathy and precision — the same qualities that strengthen my work as a QA Engineer.

**How it translates to QA:**
- 🧭 **Analytical mindset:** Conducting needs assessments honed my ability to break down problems methodically — just like analyzing root causes in defects or failed test cases.  
- 💬 **Clear communication:** Writing case documentation and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams translates into creating detailed, actionable bug reports.  
- 👂 **User advocacy:** Supporting vulnerable clients strengthened my instinct to think from the user’s perspective — a crucial mindset when evaluating usability and accessibility.  
- ⚖️ **Risk awareness:** Managing sensitive information and compliance requirements mirrors QA’s focus on quality, consistency, and reliability under real-world constraints.  

Together, these experiences shaped my QA approach: **empathetic, structured, and relentlessly focused on quality.**
